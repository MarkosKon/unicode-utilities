ff [options] [font_file..]

List fonts that support the given unicode range.

Positionals:
  font-files  The font files you want to check if they support the unicode
              range. Tip: for faster search, consider creating a file database
              with: 'find DIRECTORY -type f -name *ttf -print0 | xargs -0
              printchars --separator = > fonts-db.txt'.                 [string]

Options:
      --help                        Show help.                         [boolean]
      --version                     Show version number.               [boolean]
  -f, --database-file               The database file that contains (equal sign
                                    '=' separated) the font file name, the full
                                    font name, and the code points (the code
                                    points comma-separated). You get all of
                                    these if you run the printchars utility on
                                    your font files with printchars --separator
                                    '='.                                [string]
  -s, --printchars-field-separator  How to separate the 3 fields that the
                                    printchars utility outputs. I use '=' by
                                    default to avoid problems with paths that
                                    have spaces. It's not important what you
                                    choose, but if your paths have spaces, avoid
                                    the space as a separator. Also, if you use a
                                    database file, make sure that it's the same
                                    with the file's separator.
                                                         [string] [default: "="]
  -p, --partial                     Returns fonts that partially support the
                                    given unicode ranges.
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  -t, --partial-threshold           The percentage of the accepted character
                                    coverage for the given unicode ranges. It
                                    needs the -p or --partial option for it to
                                    work.                 [number] [default: 50]
  -u, --unicode-ranges              The unicode ranges to search for inside the
                                    files or the file db.     [array] [required]
  -V, --verbose                     Print extra information.           [boolean]

Examples:
  ff -f file-db.txt -u U+AA-FF              Returns which fonts from the files
                                            you provide or the file db support
                                            the given unicode ranges.
  ff -pt 60 -f file-db.txt -u U+00-FF       Returns the fonts that cover at
                                            least 60% of the characters for the
                                            given unicode range.
  find DIRECTORY -type f -name "*ttf"       Returns which of the font files
  -print0 | xargs -0 ff -u U+41-5A 61-7A    support the given unicode ranges.
  U+AA-FF --                                Use -- after the -u option to denote
                                            the end of the unicode ranges. This
                                            is because we have two arguments
                                            that are variable in size: the
                                            unicode ranges and the fonts files.
                                            The -u option should be last.
  ff -u U+41-5A 61-7A U+AA-FF --            Same as above but without the find
  DIRECTORY/*ttf                            command.
  ff -u $(c2n --hex '&') -- fonts/*woff*    Find which of the given fonts files
                                            have the & character. You do that
                                            with the character to number utility
                                            with command substitution.
  ff -u $(c2n -h '&' ä ß б ») --            Same as above but for more
  fonts/*woff*                              characters.
