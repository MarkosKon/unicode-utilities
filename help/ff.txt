Usage: ff [options] [font-file...]

List fonts that support the given Unicode range.

Arguments:
  font-file                                     The font files you want to check if they support the Unicode range. For faster search, consider creating a database file with the printchars utility (which printchars). For example: 'find DIRECTORY -type f -name *ttf -print0 | xargs -0 printchars --separator = > fonts-db.txt'.

Options:
  -u, --unicode-ranges <unicode_range...>       The Unicode ranges to search for inside the files or the file db.
  -f, --database-file <file>                    The database file that contains (equal sign '=' separated) the font file name, the full font name, and the code points (the code points comma-separated). You get all of these if you run the printchars utility on your font files with printchars --separator '='.
  -s, --printchars-field-separator <character>  How to separate the 3 fields that the printchars utility outputs. I use '=' by default to avoid problems with paths that have spaces. It's not important what you choose, but if your paths have spaces, avoid the space as a separator. Also, if you use a database file, make sure that it's the same with the file's separator. (default: "=")
  -p, --partial                                 Returns fonts that partially support the given Unicode ranges. (default: false)
  -t, --partial-threshold <percentage>          The percentage of the accepted character coverage for the given Unicode ranges. It needs the -p or --partial option for it to work. (default: 50)
  -V, --verbose                                 Print extra information. (default: false)
  -v, --version                                 Show the version number.
  -h, --help                                    Show this help menu.

Examples:
  1) ff -f file-db.txt -u U+AA-FF
    Prints which fonts from the file db support the given Unicode ranges.

  2) ff -pt 60 -f file-db.txt -u U+00-FF
    Prints the fonts that cover at least 60% of the characters for the given Unicode range.

  3) find DIRECTORY -type f -name "*ttf" -print0 | xargs -0 ff -u U+41-5A 61-7A U+AA-FF --
    Prints which of the font files support the given Unicode ranges. Use -- after the -u option to denote the end of the Unicode ranges. This is because we have two arguments that are variable in size: the Unicode ranges and the fonts files. The -u option should be last.

  4) ff -u U+41-5A 61-7A U+AA-FF -- DIRECTORY/*ttf
    Same as above but without the find command.

  5) ff -u $(c2n --hex '&') -- fonts/*woff*
    Find which of the given fonts files have the & character. You do that with the character to number utility with command substitution.

  6) ff -u $(c2n --hex '&' ä ß б ») -- fonts/*woff*
    Same as above but for more characters.
