USAGE: ur2n <unicode_range> [unicode_range..] [-h | --help | help]

Unicode range to number. Prints the code points for the given 
unicode ranges. More  specifically, for each unicode range you
provide, it prints in a new line: the unicode range (echoes it), 
a space, and the sorted code points for that range, comma-separated.

POSITIONALS:
  unicode_range:           See the examples for accepted unicode 
                           ranges. For complex ranges (wrapped in
                           quotes), the sub-ranges must be in order.
                           For example, this is not valid: 
                           ur2n "aa-ff 00-ff", but this is valid:
                           ur2n aa-ff 00-ff.

OPTIONS:
  -h, --help, help         Show help.   [boolean]

EXAMPLES:
  ur2n AA                  Prints the code points for a single 
                           character unicode range.  
  ur2n AA-FF               Prints the code points for a unicode range.
  ur2n aa-ff               Prints the code points for a lower-case 
                           unicode range.
  ur2n U+AA-FF             Prints the code points for a unicode range 
                           with a U+ prefix.
  ur2n "U+AA-FF, 400-500"  Prints the code points for a complex range.
  ur2n U+AA-FF, 400-500    Prints the code points for multiple ranges.
  ur2n U+AA-FF 400-500     Prints the code points for multiple ranges.
