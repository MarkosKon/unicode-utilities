c2n [options] <args..>

Returns the code points of the one-length characters you provide (<args..>). See
the options or the examples if you want different output.

Positionals:
  args  The characters you provide to the program. If you use the -r or
        --reverse option you instead provide code points (and you get
        characters). With the -h option, the numbers are not decimal code points
        but hexadecimal Unicode codes.                                  [string]

Options:
      --help           Show help.                                      [boolean]
      --version        Show version number.                            [boolean]
  -r, --reverse        Get the characters from the code points instead.
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  -h, --hex            The numbers will be hexadecimal instead of decimal.
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  -a, --append-u-plus  Append "U+" before the hexadecimal numbers.
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  -v, --verbose        Include extra info about the conversion in each line.
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]

Examples:
  c2n {a..z}               Character to number conversion. Outputs the code
                           points of the characters from a to z.
  c2n -h {a..z}            Character to hex number conversion. With the -a flag
                           it will also append U+ before the hex number.
  c2n -r {65..75}          Number (code point) to character conversion.
  c2n -rh e4 e5 u+e6 U+B2  Hex number to character conversion. The hex numbers
                           can also start with U+.
